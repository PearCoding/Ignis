Setup
=====

It is recommended to use the prebuilt binaries available at https://github.com/PearCoding/Ignis/releases and only setup Ignis from source code for development purposes.

The active development is done on a linux operating system (Ubuntu in particular) and Windows 11.
The raytracer is platform independent to a large extend and works on Linux, Windows and Mac OS operating systems. 
A reasonable powerful machine is recommended to have any fun with raytracing.
