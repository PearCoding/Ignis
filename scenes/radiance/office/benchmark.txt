Running Ignis on GPU with 16384 spp (depth 64) takes 0m56,428s
Running Ignis on GPU with 16384 spp (depth 8) takes 0m45,166s
Running Ignis on AVX2 with 16384 spp (depth 8) takes 14m22,062s
Running Ignis on Generic with 16384 spp (depth 8) takes 10m16,009s (Faster then AVX2... this is not good)
Running Radiance with "QUALITY" on MEDIUM takes 2m1,138s, but has a slight bias
Running Radiance with "QUALITY" on HIGH takes 40m7,983s, with less bias. Very similar results compared to Ignis.

-> Ignis is more noisy, but no bias
